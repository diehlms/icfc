                    Iron City Fishing Club had its origin in 1881. It had then and still has religious overtones and a few established traditions that have made it and kept it the happy summer retreat it is

                    <p><strong>IT IS TRADITIONAL</strong> for all campers to attend the Sunday morning devotional service in the dining room following breakfast and the regular Vespers Service in the Lodge at eight o'clock.</p>
                    <p><strong>IT IS TRADITIONAL</strong> not to fish on Sunday and to keep a quiet bay by reserving it for canoes and sailboats. The use of powerboats for necessary transportation may, of course, be undertaken.</p>
                    <p><strong>IT IS TRADITIONAL</strong> for every member and guest to share in keeping the Camp grounds free of litter and to keep the area surrounding their own cottage neat and trim.</p>
                    <p><strong>IT IS TRADITIONAL</strong> for campers and guests to make every effort to modulate voices and all other sounds in order to ensure a quiet camp after eleven o'clock in the evening.</p>
                    <p><strong>IT IS TRADITIONAL</strong> not to bring in any smallmouth bass under 12" in length. Should a smaller fish have been so badly hurt it will die, that fish is to be counted as one of Canada's legal limit of six smallmouth bass per day per person.</p>
