# IRON CITY FISHING CLUB

This is the updated site for ICFC in Georgian Bay, the greatest place in the world.
With this updated site, users who are activated will be able to:

* Create and share blog posts and travel updates

* Share cabin reservation dates

* Admin users can post events

* Logged in users can see others in the directory

* Read up on history and the culture of ICFC

The site is still a work in progress, and any contributions for design would be much appreciated.
