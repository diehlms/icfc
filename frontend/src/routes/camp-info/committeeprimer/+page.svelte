	<div class="text-container mt-4">
		<h4 class="text-xl font-semibold">How does a person get selected for a committee?</h4>
		<ul class="list-inside list-disc">
			<li>
				As stated in the By-Laws, the President appoints all committees and designates chairmen
				thereof, and serves as an Ex-officio Member of each committee. However, he/she usually asks
				the chairs to draw up lists of members for his/her approval.
			</li>
			<li>
				Committee Chairs invite members who have an interest, knowledge, talent, skills, or
				expertise to serve on their committee.
			</li>
			<li>Members may volunteer to participate on a committee.</li>
			<li>
				The President or other members may suggest certain individuals for committee assignment.
			</li>
			<li>
				Committee Chairs may seek diversity of representation (family, age, experience, gender,
				geography, etc.)
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h4 class="mt-4 text-xl font-semibold">How often do committees meet?</h4>
		<ul class="list-inside list-disc">
			<li>Meeting need and frequency is determined by the Committee Chair.</li>
			<li>
				Meetings may be called by the committee chair or requested by members. All committee members
				have the ability to influence committee agendas and results.
			</li>
			<li>
				The fact that Committee Members are not in camp at the same time and people are
				geographically dispersed presents challenges for normal or regular committee operations.
				Committees need to be creative and flexible. The most effective committees engage in regular
				and timely communication with all committee members.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h4 class="mt-4 text-xl font-semibold">It seems like committee membership doesn’t change.</h4>
		<ul class="list-inside list-disc">
			<li>
				Members are free to serve on committees for extended periods based on personal interest.
				Committee Chairs are encouraged to include new committee members to invite fresh
				perspectives.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h4 class="mt-4 text-xl font-semibold">
			Is there an average size of membership or maximum number for committees?
		</h4>
		<ul class="list-inside list-disc">
			<li>There is no formula. Committees number from 4 to 16 members.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4 class="mt-4 text-xl font-semibold">
			What if my name appears on a committee and I don’t have an interest in that committee?
		</h4>
		<ul class="list-inside list-disc">
			<li>
				Representation is voluntary. There is no requirement to serve on a committee. You may choose
				at any time to terminate or change committee affiliation.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h4 class="mt-4 text-xl font-semibold">
			I never hear from the chairperson. We rarely have meetings. I don’t know what’s going on.
		</h4>
		<ul class="list-inside list-disc">
			<li>
				Collaborate with the Committee Chair to revisit the overall purpose, strategies, and short-
				and long-term objectives of the committee. Express your concerns and offer support. Perhaps
				there are ways you and others can help the Chair with the committee process.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h4 class="mt-4 text-xl font-semibold">Are there term limits for committee chairs?</h4>
		<ul class="list-inside list-disc">
			<li>
				No. Each President appoints or sanctions Committee Chairs and contributes ideas for
				committee representation.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h4 class="mt-4 text-xl font-semibold">
			How are committees held accountable for their contributions?
		</h4>
		<ul class="list-inside list-disc">
			<li>
				In collaboration with the Committee Chairs, the President addresses objectives,
				accountabilities, and performance standards.
			</li>
			<li>Committee members determine strategies, accountabilities, and deliverables.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4 class="mt-4 text-xl font-semibold">
			What is the interface between the BOD and committees?
		</h4>
		<ul class="list-inside list-disc">
			<li>
				To quote the Yearbook: Committees generally work with and through the Club staff. They
				establish programs, policies, and procedures in their respective areas and advise the
				President and the Business Manager. Committee chairpersons should convene their committees
				in advance of encampment and several times during the season, where possible. Member
				suggestions and/or complaints should be addressed to the appropriate committee chairperson.
			</li>
			<li>Committee Chairs prepare information, reports, and minutes for the BOD.</li>
			<li>The BOD may provide strategic direction for committees.</li>
