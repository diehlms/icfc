			<h4>Our Historical Setting</h4>
			<p>
				Tradition informs us that two great Indian nations known as the Mengwe and the Lenni-Lenape
				came from the north and west of the Mississippi River where they met the Alligewi who were
				on the east side of the river. A great conflict resulted and the Alligewi were defeated, the
				victors dividing the territory. The Mengwe took the territory about the Great Lakes and the
				Lenni-Lenape the territory south of the lakes. The two great descendants of these
				traditional Indians are known to us as the Iroquois and the Algonquins, and we are all
				familiar with the wonderful self-government of the Iroquois from whom many suggestions came
				in the development of our free American government.
			</p>
			<p>
				The most important contact with the North American aborigines in the Georgian Bay territory
				was in 1615 when Samuel de Champlain, the great explorer, ascended the St. Lawrence River to
				the Ottawa River, up thence to the country of the Algonquins on Lake Nipissing. After
				remaining here two days he entered the French River to Lake Attigoutan (Georgian Bay). There
				he found Indian corn and squashes, blue berries and raspberries. He met a tribe of 300 men
				who painted their faces and carried only bows and arrows as arms. Their nostrils were
				pierced and their ears adorned with beads. The chief told him they came here to camp and
				dried blueberries for their wonder food. The next day Champlain followed the shore of the
				Georgian Bay which he said contained many islands and which he named the “Fresh Sea”. He saw
				fish 4½ feet long. The country bordering this sea was inhabited by savages. Later he crossed
				a bay—Matchedash, and crossed the country between Georgian Bay and Lake Simcoe. He described
				this as being very pleasant and the Indian corn was far advanced. This was the latter part
				of July. He arrived at Cahiague (near Orillia) on August 17 where he was “received with
				great delight” by the savages. These were at war with the Iroquois and they reported another
				nation some distance away also a war that could supply 500 good men if Champlain would
				assist them in an expedition against the Iroquois.
			</p>
			<p>
				When the men were all assembled Champlain began his march on September 1st. They crossed
				Lake Ontario in a southerly direction and landed at a point west of Hungry Bay or possibly
				in Henderson Bay.
			</p>
			<p>
				After several days’ journey they came to the enemy’s stronghold, the site of which is
				supposed to have been at the town of Fenner, Madison County, New York.
			</p>
			<p>
				Champlain’s account of their attack on this fort is most interesting. Suffice it to say
				Champlain found his warriors preferred to fight in their own way and the enemy being well
				fortified did not suffer much from the attack.
			</p>
			<p>
				Probably the most important contact was the efforts made at evangelization of the Indians.
				About the same time the Champlain was making his explorations up the Ottawa, the Recollet
				friars erected a mission at Huronia for the Huron Indians south of Georgian Bay. This passed
				to the Jesuits in 1626.
			</p>
			<p>
				However not much progress was made until the year 1634 when Brebeuf, Daniel and Lalement
				inaugurated a mission among the Hurons. Christian villages were established along the lakes,
				bays and rivers between the Georgian Bay to Lake Simcoe.
			</p>
			<p>
				In 1640 Brebeuf built on the River Wye a fortified stone house which was christened “St.
				Marie”. This was the central residence for the Jesuit missionaries working among the Huron
				in that vicinity. Some years later the Iroquois closed the water communication to Quebec and
				1648 ended the Huron expeditions. In this year Cardinal Richelieu, Prime Minister of France,
				sent aid to missionaries and a fortification was built surrounding St. Marie.
			</p>
			<p>
				A cannon sent from Quebec in this year to strengthen the fortification is said to be
				preserved in the Library at Penetanguishene. The following year St. Ignac and St. Louis were
				destroyed and the Fathers Brebeuf and Lalement were cruelly slain by the Iroquois. The
				greater part of the Huron nation was destroyed in the remainder took refuge on Christian
				Island. Ft. St. Marie was destroyed by the Jesuits rather than have it fall into the hands
				of the Iroquois. They then retired to Christian Island where the second Ft. St. Marie was
				built.
			</p>
			<p>
				The beautiful shrine about a mile from Midland, in which we pass on our trip to camp, was
				built by the Jesuits as a memorial church to the Canadian martyrs on the site of all St.
				Marie.
			</p>
			<p>
				After the annihilation of the Hurons by the Iroquois, the Algonquins, or as we know them,
				the Chippewa or Ojibway Indians, began to settle on the lands formerly occupied by the
				Hurons. For almost a century they were unmolested, the chiefs dividing hunting and fishing
				territory, each having a river and its tributaries, the rights on which were respected by
				the other chiefs.
			</p>
			<p>
				They lived in wigwams made of three poles about 15 ft. long with crotches at the bottom so
				that they would be held firmly in the ground. The upper ends were fastened with strips of
				bark. Over the outside were plaited mats of grass or birch bark. An opening at the top was
				left for the exit of smoke. Skins of animals formed the door. The family sat on mats on the
				floor much the same as the early Japanese.
			</p>
			<p>
				In 1828, General Darling reported that the Chippewas who formerly occupied the lands about
				Lake Simcoe, Holland River and the unsettled country expressed their desire to become
				Christians and adopt the habits of civilized life, so in 1830 Lieutenant-Governor Sir J.
				Colborne, assigned them attract of 9800 acres of land on the northwest shore of Lake Simcoe.
				There were three tribes of Chippewas under Chiefs Yellow Head, Aisance and Snake, also some
				Pottawatamies from Drummond Island. A descendant of Chief Aisance, bearing the same name, is
				among our Indians.
			</p>
			<p>
				This brings us to the period when the ancestors of our present Indian guides fished and
				hunted about our camp and of which we have heard interesting stories. The historical setting
				of our camp site is seen to extend into the last 300 years and who can say that Champlain
				did not visit our beautiful sand beach or ascend the Moon River to the falls while on his
				journey down to Matchedash Bay amid magnificent scenery.
			</p>

			<p>How It All Came About</p>
			<p>
				An article which appeared in the Pittsburgh Christian Advocate on September 15, 1881, was
				the seed from which in half a century has come the present ample growth of the Iron City
				Fishing Club. This article, enpd “A Canadian Fishing Excursion”, was written by the Rev. Dr.
				W.F. Day, then pastor of the Methodist Episcopal Church in Titusville, Pennsylvania. Dr. Day
				told a brief and graphic story of a camping trip taken in August, 1881, by a party of
				Titusville men, of whom he was one, to Lake Sparrow and the lower Severn River. His story
				was read by the Rev. Dr. Charles W. Smith, then Presiding Elder of the Pittsburgh District
				of the Methodist Episcopal Church, and it suggested to him the organization of a party to
				camp on Lake Sparrow the following summer. As a result of his efforts the interest of a
				number of friends was enlisted.
			</p>
			<p>
				At the same time the same article attracted the attention of Rev. Dr. Joseph W. Miles, then
				pastor of the Methodist Episcopal Church in the West End, Pittsburgh, who discussed it with
				several of his friends, among them Samuel L. Wood, J.O. Wood, B.D. Wood, Alex. McDavid and
				T.P. Hershberger, and they decided to join Dr. Day’s party. Shortly before the party was to
				leave, illness in Dr. Day’s family prevented his going, and the result was that the two
				groups got together and organized the Iron City Fishing Club.
			</p>
			<p>
				Several meetings were held in office of Lee S. Smith, 52 Sixth Street, Pittsburgh, and a
				tentative organization was formed with Charles W. Smith as President, Lee S. Smith,
				Secretary and Samuel L. Wood, Treasurer. To look after the Commissary purchases Wenman A.
				Lewis was appointed, and with the assistance of William H. Slack as Commissary this
				important matter was in due time attended to in plain but substantial fashion.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>The First Encampment</p>
			<p>
				Plans were made to go to Lake Sparrow on August 7, 1882, by way of the Pittsburgh & Lake
				Erie Railroad. The financial arrangements for this first trip of the Club were much more
				modest than those of the Fiftieth. Before the date of starting each member paid to the
				Treasurer $11.00 for railroad fare and $9.00 to cover cost of provisions, table and kitchen
				outfit, wages of the cook, and hire of five skiffs.
			</p>
			<p>
				A uniform camp dress was informally adopted, prominent in which were a heavy blue flannel
				shirt and folding tan linen Lone Fisherman hat at that time so popular for outing wear. In
				addition to these purchased items, the uniform was completed from home wardrobes with a most
				astonishing assortment of old trousers. These well served the purpose, but the less written
				of them here the better. Let them be remembered tenderly for their service, not their
				beauty.
			</p>
			<p>
				The party as finally listed for the trip was as follows: C.W. Smith, Lee S. Smith, S.L.
				Wood, H.J. Smith, J.W. Miles, G.T. Reynolds, C. L. Smith, C.C. Scaife, W.L. Smith, W.H.
				Slack, J.O. Wood, B.D. Wood, S.A. Shepard, Reed Slack, W.W. Ramsey, N.S. Williams, Walter
				Williams, J.V. Brobst, J.H. Pollitt, W.A. Lewis, G.L. Lewis, H.D. Stewart, Alexander McDavid
				and T.P. Hershberger.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Club left old Lake Erie station at 10:40 o’clock on the morning of Monday, August 7,
				1882. The trip was made in a combination car, the Club members occupying the passenger
				section and their baggage filling the other. The journey was marked by a lengthening series
				of bumpy transfers of the special car from one train to another, these being made at
				Youngstown, Ashtabula, Buffalo, Suspension Bridge and Hamilton.
			</p>
			<p>
				At Youngstown a telegram was sent to Toronto asking the Northern and Northwestern Railway
				Company to charter to the Club a special engine to haul the car at night without loss of
				time from Hamilton to Severn Bridge. The engine was ready at Hamilton and the special night
				trip was begun. In the morning as they neared their destination, the awaking members of the
				party discovered that the railroad company, in a fit of great generosity, had thrown in with
				the engine a long freight train for good measure, and were hauling it with the Club’s
				chartered engine, with the Club car rattling along jauntily at the tail end. The Club
				members were deeply impressed by this gracious act.
			</p>
			<p>
				Arriving at Severn Bridge at 8 o’clock on the morning of August 8, some of the party took
				the tents in the skiffs which were waiting and rowed four miles down the lovely Severn River
				to Monahan’s Point, where the Severn River widens into Lake Sparrow, and began to set up the
				camp. Later in the day the rest of the party with the baggage were towed down the River on a
				scow by a small tug at a speed not much faster than the flow of the current.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the camp there were five sleeping tents and one commissary tent. The cook slept among the
				provisions -- very much so, indeed. There was no cookhouse, all preparation of meals being
				done in the open, along the river bank, with the aid of two sets of four-legged grate bars
				and a dutch oven. There was no dining tent. Rough board tables, with equally rough board
				seats, were built between some clumps of trees close by the river. If it rained while the
				meals were being eaten, as it did every day but two during the encampment, the patient
				diners waited until the water rose to an embarrassing height in their plates, when they
				tipped them up and drained off the flood onto the table. As the table was already soaking
				wet the added moisture was not noticed. All dishes were of tin, and the knives and forks had
				black wooden handles. The majority of the meals were eaten in raincoats. The serving of the
				meals was done by the Club members in turn, two being appointed each day to act as waiters.
				The tents were without floors, and small boards were at a premium for use on the damp ground
				to step on when getting out of bed. Canvas cots were used, and, owing to inexperience, bed
				clothing was none too plentiful.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Club remained in camp eight days. An official record of the catch of fish was kept by
				the President, all members reporting to him and he judicially supervising the weighing. The
				total amounted to six hundred and twenty-five pounds of black bass, pickerel, blue catfish,
				pike and muscallonge.
			</p>
			<p>
				On Sunday, August 13, the Club began its series of services of worship which have been
				continued without intermission for fifty years. The first sermon was preached by the Rev.
				Dr. W.W. Ramsey, then pastor of Christ Methodist Episcopal Church, Pittsburgh. One hundred
				and ten persons were present. In a praise service held that evening, led by Prof. W. H.
				Slack, eighty persons were in attendance.
			</p>
			<p>
				On Saturday, August 19, the party, happy in their new experiences, arrived again in
				Pittsburgh. On the return trip the baggage was checked, there being no special car. By a
				mistake at Buffalo it was delivered to the connecting lines of the Pennsylvania Railroad and
				came to Pittsburgh over the Allegheny Valley Railroad. Delivery was refused on presentation
				of the checks except on payment of express rate charges. The attorneys belonging to the Club
				went into court and suited out writs of replevin, armed with which the Sheriff recovered the
				impounded baggage. Amid such mild excitement ended the first Outing of the Iron City Fishing
				Club.
			</p>
			<p>
				On the return of the party, such had been the success of the trip that the Club was
				considered permanently organized. The elected officers were continued, with the official
				addition of Professor Slack as Commissary, and the Club membership was limited to thirty.
			</p>
			<p>
				There were no ladies in the camping party the first year. Mrs. C.C. Scaife and two small
				sons, Verner and William, were staying at the home of Mr. Monahan, on whose property the
				Club was camping, and they were often in the Camp and at the Club table.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ladies were taken to camp the second year of the Club. When the matter was first discussed
				it was proposed to erect a board shanty for them, it being assumed that they would not wish
				to undergo the hardships of those primitive camps, but they would have none of it. They
				insisted on tenting like the rest of us, and they had the time of their lives. The pioneer
				lady campers in this camp numbered five, Mrs. J. O. Wood, Mrs. Lee S. Smith, Mrs. J. B.
				Brobst, Mrs. W. A. Lewis and Mrs. C.C. Scaife.
			</p>

			<p>Early Encampments</p>
			<p>
				The period in the history of the Club covering the wanderings in the wilderness before it
				came to the promised land which it has so delightfully occupied during the past thirty
				years, records this list of encampments:

				This series of nineteen encampments marked a steady growth in the number of campers and an
				increase in the comforts of camping. The earlier encampments were seasons of simple and very
				primitive outdoor life. Days were spent in fishing. When evening came the party gathered in
				the open around a huge campfire of logs, and with songs and story telling, seasoned with
				much hilarious merrymaking and old-time minstrel fun, the hours passed all too quickly. When
				the growth of the Club relegated these old campfire revels to the realm of happy memory
				something went out which has never been exactly replaced.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>The Pioneer Builders</p>
			<p>
				During the twenty pioneer years of the life of the Club, as later, the elected and appointed
				officers were continued with but few changes. They were the men whose faithful and
				unrequited labors laid deep and firm the foundations on which their successors have builded
				so well. Charles W. Smith as President, Lee S. Smith as Secretary, Samuel L. Wood as
				Treasurer, and William H. Slack as Commissary, served for many years. At times during these
				early years Joseph W. Miles and William H. Slack served as Vice-president. And not to be
				forgotten are the labors of James O. Wood as Master of Transportation, in which capacity he
				did most arduous work; and of “Uncle John” Pollitt as Post Master General and Chief of the
				Fire Department, to which important offices he brought the dignity of long experience and
				genial age.
			</p>
			<p>
				The cook who did such yeoman service out in the rain on the river bank during the first
				encampment was Henry Woods, known to all as “Smoke”. He was an efficient maker of camp
				meals, and withal a most interesting character. He continued to preside in the kitchen year
				after year until 1894, when circumstances made a change advisable. “Smoke” was a unique
				personage. For his ability as a camp cook, his personal traits and his unusual life
				experiences he is worthy of far more mention that can here be made. Every pioneer Iron City
				camper richly enjoys memories of “Smoke”.
			</p>
			<p>-- Charles H. Smith</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>Contrasts</p>
			<p>
				The changes of fifty years have been striking. The first camp consisted of about thirty
				people, housed in half a dozen tents. There were in camp last summer 152 Members and Guests,
				with about fifty help. A standard tent of the first camp was 12 by 14 feet and
				accommodated—more or less—from three to five people. Bunks of rough lumber and ticks filled
				with straw sufficed for furniture. “Lumber for bunks, 50¢; making, 25¢”. But they were no
				profiteers. “Hay for beds at cost”. In 1897 they became more metropolitan. The Outing
				Assessment included “bunks and straw”. And it is but a few years since the last supply of
				straw, unused through the advent of springs and mattresses, was dug out from under the Club
				House.
			</p>
			<p>
				The membership has been very tenacious of the rusticity of tent life, and it was not until a
				“three day blow” wrecked eight tents one night in 1923 that the building of wooden cabins
				was countenanced, under strict limitations as to size and outside finish. The present
				housing equipment consists of thirty rather luxurious cottages and twenty large tents, and
				the tents are being replaced by cottages as fast as they reach the end of their usefulness.
			</p>
			<p>
				The circus tent dining hall evolved in 1902 into the Club House, which is now equipped with
				accommodations for 150, with a late type hotel kitchen, adequate refrigeration, power plant
				etc., and two dormitories for help.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>Social Life</p>
			<p>
				The early social life centered around the evening camp fire. But beware! “On Motion, the
				President was instructed to notify all campers that all noises in camp must cease at 10:30
				P.M. unless on special occasion of club concert.” After the advent of the Club House the
				big, open fireplace furnished the “campfire” and the cleared dining room floor soon raised
				the specter of dancing. They wisely decided against government by injunction, and instead
				“requested the members and friends to refrain from round dancing”. The building of the
				Assembly House, later named the Lodge, as a social center, brought in a more liberal mind,
				and it was resolved “that more latitude should be allowed the young people, especially along
				the line of dancing, but that absence from camp after hours be strictly curtailed”. From
				this the transition to semi-weekly dances and blackface minstrels was easy.
			</p>
			<p>
				Under the system of itinerancy which characterize the early encampments, not unnaturally as
				the founders were Methodist ministers, the tents, and, when they were acquired later, the
				row boats were stored in a convenient farmer’s barn over the winter and were carted the next
				summer to the site of the new camp. This work was a great burden. An advance party had to go
				week ahead, select the camp site and put up the tents. In 1893 it cost $5.00 to store the
				goods in a farmer’s barn and $10.00 to cart them to the next camp site.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>Sandy Beach</p>
			<p>
				The early camps were on private land without charge. The club expressed its appreciation to
				the owner of the land at Deep Bay Point, Sparrow Lake, by paying his taxes on the land. When
				the camp was at Go Home Bay the property was acquired by the Madawaska Club, and they
				demanded $100. for the use of the camp site. The Club paid it that year, but started a hunt
				for the fabled sandy beach of which Jerry Monague had boyish recollections of visiting with
				his father. Dr. Miles, Capt. T.J. Wood, James L. Klingensmith, with Jerry and his nephew for
				guides, went in a sail boat from Go Home Bay to Captain Allen Straits, where they camped the
				first night. The next morning they rowed to Moon Falls, and the following day they sailed
				back to one of the small islands in front of our present side, when the glistening sand
				caught their view and they went over to the beach in row boats. The location seemed so
				desirable that they returned to camp at Go Home Bay and a day or two later the camp tug took
				the officers to inspect the new site. It was at once decided to locate here the next year,
				and the camp of 1900 was accordingly at “Sandy Beach near Moon River, Georgian Bay”, where
				it has been ever since.
			</p>
			<p>
				It was coming to this camp that the Masonic Rock was put on the map. The tug “Masonic”,
				bringing in the women and children stuck on the reef, and the big sail boat that put out
				from camp to take them off also stuck on the reef, and the men who stayed on Jubilee Island
				to come over on the next trip had an all day wait.
			</p>
			<p>
				The acquiring of p to the land had its oddities. The Canadian government would not grant a
				patent for government land to a foreign corporation, but would grant p to an alien
				individual, who in turn could transfer a good p to the foreign corporation. Therefore p to
				the 194 acres of land, being the shore ends of four quarter sections and embracing just a
				mile of water frontage, was at acquired by J. Harvey Harrison, at cost of about $3.00 an
				acre, whereupon it was deeded to the Club corporation which was chartered in 1901.
			</p>
			<p>
				At that time we bought from Mr. Breithaupt, who is yet our near neighbor on Woods Bay, for
				$100., all the timber on the land except the pine. And in 1907, when it was learned that the
				pine was to be cut, it cost us $500. to save that from the woodman’s axe.
			</p>
			<p>
				With the coming of a permanent location, and the building of the Club House in 1902, a care
				taker became necessary to protect the larger investment. William Myers, who still lives on
				Moon River, was the first care taker, but would not stay longer than a year. He was
				succeeded by a procession of Indian care takers. Enoch Monague for two years, Robert Marsden
				for four years, “Big Jim” King, the Constable at Christian Island, for five years. In 1917
				the present care taker, Robert McCracken, a Scotch-Irishman, was elected, the most
				dependable and most satisfactory care taker in our experience.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>Fires</p>
			<p>
				It was during this period that we learned about fires. Very early in our occupancy of “Sandy
				Beach” we learned that dry moss will burn, and burn, and burn. The island we know as Burnt
				Island, across the bay in front of Camp, took fire either with or without the assistance of
				some of our campers, and the whole camp turned out and extinguished the fire. The third day
				it flamed up again and again we extinguished it. This happened every few days during the
				entire encampment and the moss away down between the rocks was smoking when we left for
				home. Another year the tent of the colored cook, pitched just beyond the Club House, took
				fire one in windy afternoon, destroying everything but the cook. Three years later the “John
				Lee” steamer burned during the encampment, necessitating our return via scows, a drenching
				rain and Rose Point. And shortly after that a forest fire devastated several miles of the
				shore north of our camp, with smoke so dense that our camp steamer got lost in it, and a
				heavy rain stopped the fire less than half a mile from our property.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>The "Iron City"</p>
			<p>
				A club Steamer was a source of great pleasure—and trouble. At first one was hired simply to
				haul the party to camp and out again. In 1897 the Secretary was authorized “to engage a tug
				boat during the entire camp”. This service was obtained for $6.00 a day for boat, captain
				and engineer, the Club to board them. In 1906 the “Louisa Lee” was bought, and then our
				troubles began. The steamer required a licensed pilot and engineer. Also numerous and
				expensive repairs. Also diplomacy. One day the engineer got mad, stoked up a big fire,
				clamped down the main shaft so tight that it would not turn, and skipped out. By good luck
				someone happened to catch it before the boiler blew up.
			</p>
			<p>
				After years of tribulation the “Iron City”, as the “Louisa Lee” had been renamed, was sold
				for a fraction of its original cost, and for several years a launch and operator were hired
				each season, Elijah Light, the present owner of Copperhead Hotel and Island, being the most
				delightful boatmen of them all. Later our own Caretaker was encouraged to buy a suitable
				launch, and we pay him for the use of it during the encampment with no responsibility for it
				the rest of the year.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>Financing</p>
			<p>
				The early camp was for a period of one week, which by stages has been lengthened to seven.
				The cost of living at the first camp was $9.00. In 1890 the assessment was fixed at $30.00,
				which, after paying $14.35 for the railroad fare and $1.50 each way for the Pullman, left
				$12.65 for living expenses for the two weeks in camp. And they flourished on it. The charge
				for “rowers”, (they scorned “guides” in those days) was 50¢ a day. It was not until 1902
				that they jumped the rate on “guides” to 25¢ a meal. And the daily wage of the slavey was
				$1.50.
			</p>
			<p>
				Annual Dues were fixed at $2.00 by amendment to the Constitution in 1890. A deficit at the
				end of the year was a frequent occurrence. The first Special Assessment was proposed at
				$8.00 in 1899, but its visage was too frightful so they gave a note instead. Compare these
				figures with a Outing Assessment of $245, annual dues of $50., and Special Assessments of
				$100., and you will see how far the expansion of this age has taken us.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>Water Transportaion</p>
			<p>
				The primitive motive power was an “ash breeze” applied either to a rowboat or a canoe, and a
				fishing trip started at four o’clock A.M., to afford time for the “breeze” to function and
				reach the fishing grounds in due time. The original row boats, bought in 1898, cost $15, and
				some of them are still in service. But row boats have almost entirely disappeared except as
				tenders to motor boats. The first gasoline propelled launch was brought to camp by Henry
				Tranter in 1907, and he spent three weeks out of the four trying to make it go. Those “one
				lungers” would run about six miles an hour under favorable circumstances, but they were
				exceedingly temperamental. The latest type of motor boat, resplendent in polished mahogany
				and silver, will jerk you over the water at a speed of forty-five miles an hour, and your
				pleasure trip is done before it’s well begun. The strength of its 200 horses represents the
				growth of the original horse-and-a-half in twenty years.
			</p>
			<p>
				The early camps were on small interior lakes, and the port of embarcation was frequently the
				railroad station on the Severn River. When the camps were pitched on the shores of Lake
				Huron the route changed to Penetang and a chartered steamer of some size to take the party
				directly to camp. The “City of Toronto” was the first of these larger steamers. The
				arrangement was quite convenient. Upon the arrival of the party at Penetang at daylight the
				steamer then took them across the bay to the Penetanguishene Hotel, a very elaborate summer
				hotel for that kind region. While the people were eating breakfast the baggage was being
				loaded on the steamer, and the lake trip started immediately after breakfast.
			</p>
			<p>
				Later the “John Lee” was chartered for the purpose, and after it burned, arrangements were
				made with the Northern Navigation Company to have the steamer “Waubic” branch off its
				regular run to Parry Sound to Jubilee Island and take us in to our dock. The “Waubic” made
				the run between Penetang and Parry Sound under contract with the Grand Trunk railroad, but
				the service never paid expenses, and as soon as the contract expired the Northern Navigation
				Company refused to renew it.
			</p>
			<p>
				That left a considerable tourist territory without water transportation, and no other means
				was possible. Immediately considerable rivalry arose between Penetang and Midland on the
				south, and Parry Sound on the north, as to a boat line for this service, the railroad
				agreeing to make its port the town that furnished the service. Both Midland and Penetang
				formed boat lines, but the Midland boat was far the better and the two were finally combined
				in the Midland Company, the “Georgian Bay Tourist Company” whose steamer, “City of Midland”
				has given us the best service we ever had.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>Fishing</p>
			<p>
				Fishing was the end of existence to the “fathers”. In 1894 a report of a license fee of
				$5.00 on each male member caused a hasty and unanimous decision not to go to Canada. But
				other information that this law did not apply in the Muskoka District, the decision was
				reconsidered. The first license fee was $2.00, with a family rate of $3.00. But families
				increased so marvelously that the rate was discontinued the following year. But war time
				exigency raised the rate to $5.50 per capita, wherein is pegged. At one time the Secretary
				was given books of blank licenses, to be issued as needed; but now no one may touch the
				blanks but a sworn agent, and he must record the color of your eyes, the condition of your
				teeth and the number of unmarried sisters in the family.
			</p>
			<p>
				Being a law-abiding people, a Committee was appointed in 1896, consisting of Dr. Miles,
				Jesse Jones and Professor Harry Horner, “to report on the fishing laws of Canada and enforce
				them during our encampment”. There is no record that they ever arrested anyone for violating
				the law.
			</p>
			<p>
				As time progressed, and the membership became soft and slept late, the sturdy pioneer
				rebelled, and, beginning in 1896, by giving previous notice, he-men could have six o’clock
				breakfast and get to fishing at a sensible hour.
			</p>
			<p>
				The pioneer fishing trip was an all-camp party. With but one steamer, everybody towed
				behind. But now the fishing trip has become a rock dinner, starting before
				noon—sometimes—and caparisoned with cushions, camp chairs and card tables. A few of the
				Mid-Victorians still fish, and enjoy it; but fishing is no longer de rigueur. “O tempora, O
				mores!” [Alas, for the times and the manners!]
			</p>
			<p>
				There are those in camp yet who remember when Johnny Hawk paddled his squaw and papoose from
				Christian Island to camp in a birch bark canoe, and sold the birch bark canoe to one of the
				campers for the unheard of extravagance of $20.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>Athletics</p>
			<p>
				There has always been an element that wanted more diversion than merely fishing. When the
				present property was purchased, 1901, a tennis court was built, and surfaced with clay
				brought from Penetang, and tennis is still one of the outstanding sports of camp life. A
				croquet ground was also laid out, and for years it was the chief land sport. But the site
				has been smoothed up for a soft ball field now, and last year witnessed the first contest
				with an outside team in which we came in second best. A team of Indians from Christian
				Island did things to our team that very greatly surprised them.
			</p>
			<p>
				Base Ball had its innings, and for some years our ball players went to Parry Sound once a
				year and trimmed them—with the assistance of what college players we could pick up in our
				immediate vicinity. Our enthusiasm even led to clearing up a ballpark a short distance out
				the Twosers Trail, but the sand would not grow a good sod and the underbrush grew too
				rapidly, and the venture was never a success.
			</p>
			<p>
				One year some golf enthusiasts brought up some floating balls and driving out into the lake
				with Indian caddies in canoes was a great sport. The later golf bugs go to Parry Sound to
				play, where they have very satisfactory links with unmatched scenery.
			</p>
			<p>
				To catch them early, swings and slides and teeter boards were provided for the small
				children—and mostly monopolized by the larger ones! Wonderful the fun the grown up kids got
				out of it.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>Sanitation and Health</p>
			<p>
				The health of the camp has always been matter of especial care. From the very early days a
				Camp Physician has been taken along to look after the health of the campers without charge.
				Of recent years, when the larger attendance has brought on problems of the denser
				settlement, a committee of physicians who has had general sanitary conditions under their
				particular control, the water supply has been frequently tested, the disposal of the kitchen
				refuse watched, and generally a first class Board of Health maintained. Two physicians have
				been outstanding in his work as Camp Physicians. Dr. J.J. Thomas, of Youngstown, O., until
				1913, when membership in the national executive body of his Church required his presence at
				its meetings; and from 1913 until the condition of his health interfered, 1930, Dr. Stewart
				L. McCurdy. Dr. McCurdy was especially valuable as Camp Physician, because our great threat
				is not so much disease as accident, and his experience as a railroad surgeon stood us in
				good stead on many occasions. And yet a few serious cases have been met. One girl developed
				typhoid fever the day after her arrival, and was carried through the fever in camp and taken
				home well. A case of appendicitis developed at another time, and had to be taken to the
				hospital. One year the colored cook from a nearby camp cut an artery and Dr. McCurdy stood
				between her and death. Another time some men came eighty miles by canoe from a lumber camp
				with a broken leg for our Camp Physician to heal. But in all the years of our camp life we
				have been spared a serious accident or fatality, largely because of these precautions and,
				as we like to believe, because our ethical standards in camp are kept on the home basis.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>Maps</p>
			<p>
				The original camp on the present grounds was pitched in a triangle extending from the
				clubhouse along “Rattle Snake Row” to a point just beyond the present walk from the bathing
				beach to the tennis courts, with a triangle between that and the lake. The tents were so
				close together that their guy ropes interfered and there was nothing even resembling
				privacy. The Caretaker’s house was on the shore near the site of the Lodge and beautiful
				pine grove beyond was the Indian camp. After several proposals for a broader lay-out, for
				the original proposal of which Walter Miles should receive the credit, it was finally
				determined, in 1916, to put the Indians and the Caretaker on the back bay and extend the row
				of tents along the shore to the Island, with a clear space between tents of eighteen feet,
				eliminating all the tents in front of “Rattle Snake Row”.
			</p>
			<p>
				The first island was purchased with this plan in mind, and it was at first the Mecca of the
				clerical brethren and known as Dominie Island. The camping of a family of undesirables on
				Huckleberry Island one summer demonstrated the danger of unoccupied property near our camp,
				and we promptly bought the other two islands immediately opposite our shore line.
			</p>
			<p>
				The first map of the camp was drawn by Magnus Pflaum in 1908. In 1910 Elmer K. Hiles, then
				Secretary of the Engineers Society of Western Pennsylvania, amplified this map. In 1918
				Richard Hirsch, Designing Engineer of the Kirke Porter Locomotive Works, made an actual
				survey of the camp in a large plot which in 1929 was brought up to date by W. Archie Weldin.
				The first attempt to map the adjacent waters was made by J. Walter Miles and Johnny Hawk in
				1909, and a very accurate map of the bay and the islands was the result of their summer
				cruising. The Canadian government made a thorough survey in 1912, and last year a map of the
				whole territory was made by aerial photography. This last is especially interesting as it
				gives us our first accurate information as to the land “back in the bush”.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>Membership</p>
			<p>
				The reception of new members has always been fenced about with restrictions. Election was by
				ballot, and it required a three-fourths vote to elect. In 1896 election to membership was
				refused to two pretty prominent Pittsburghers, one of whom was later accepted. In recent
				years there has been added the requisite that the applicant must have attended a previous
				encampment and proved congenial.
			</p>
			<p>
				The membership limit was fixed in the first organization at thirty. In 1889 the limit was
				raised to forty, and the number was increased to fifty when the Club was incorporated in
				1901.
			</p>
			<p>
				In 1916, when it was realized that the number of ministers in the membership was running
				low, with a desire to maintain that element of our social life, five ministerial memberships
				were authorized, at nominal cost and dues and without property interest. This number was
				later increased to ten, but more than five have never yet been outstanding.
			</p>
			<p>
				Some question has been raised recently as to the rule adopted in 1925 limiting Membership
				Outing Rates to two persons of the Member’s family, claiming it to be an objectionable
				innovation. In 1894, and possibly earlier, the Member’s rate applied only to the individual
				Member, all his family paying the higher rate. Later there were three rates applied, one for
				the Member, a higher one for his family, and a still higher one for “Visitors”.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>Masonic Visitation</p>
			<p>
				The Masonic fraternity has always had a considerable representation among the membership,
				some of whom have attained high rank. These have included the presiding officer of the
				national body of Knights Templar, to presiding officers of the state body in Pennsylvania,
				and more than a dozen 33° Masons. In 1927 our Club had the pleasure of entertaining the
				Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Canada, Hon. John A. Rowland, accompanied by an escort of
				Granite Lodge, Parry Sound.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>Literary Genius</p>
			<p>
				There has been a great deal of literary talent in our camp. There may be some question as to
				the literary value of the Club Yell, of which Dr. Miles gets the credit for being the
				perpetrator-in-chief, but there can be no question as to the Club Song, of which Mrs. Rev.
				Thos. R. Thoburn is the gifted author. And last summer we had a real poet laureate, Mr.
				Bennett Chapple, from whose poetic musings we reproduce several examples.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>The Sabbath</p>
			<p>
				With all the comforts, even luxuries, of today, one characteristic of the first camp has
				persisted in its full vigor throughout our whole history. Sunday is the Sabbath, whether at
				home or in camp. From the first Sunday of the first camp there has never been an omission of
				the service of worship in camp on Sunday throughout the entire fifty years. Our Club has a
				reputation throughout Canada for “remembering the Sabbath Day”. Under the shadow of these
				principles we have been preserved without a serious accident through all these years. And we
				take a proper pride in maintaining these standards.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>Officers</p>
			<p>
				Long tenure of office has been characteristic of the Club. There was substantially no change
				in officers during the first fifteen years. In the half-century of its existence it has had
				but two Presidents, Bishop Smith from its inception to the time of his death in 1915, and
				W.S. Horner from that time to the present.
			</p>
			<p>
				For Secretaries, Lee S. Smith, brother of the Bishop, was Secretary until 1896; Will Price
				from 1896 to 1900; S.C. Johnston from 1900 to 1904; John W. MacGregor from 1904 to 1906;
				W.S. Horner from 1906 to 1910; and Sion B. Smith from 1910 to the present.
			</p>
			<p>
				Samuel L. Wood was Treasurer until 1904. W.S. Horner then served for two years, J. Frank
				Miller for four years, B.W. Lewis for four years, and Sidney F. Murphy for four years. At
				the death of Mr. Murphy the offices of Secretary and Treasurer were combined.
			</p>
			<p>
				William H. Slack was Vice-President and Commissary until 1896, when Benjamin Dangerfield was
				elected Commissary. With the advent of a permanent location came more effective business
				methods. Charles L. Smith, son of the first President, served as Commissary from 1901 to
				1908, when Elmer L. Kidney succeeded him. It was under the latter that our present voucher
				system of accounting was adopted. In 1916 John F. Jose, who had been assistant to Mr.
				Kidney, became Commissary, and has handled the complexities of the modern commissary
				department with efficiency and satisfaction ever since.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>The Air Age</p>
			<p>
				So much for the past. A new era opened for the Iron City Fishing Club last summer, the air
				age. We were very much surprised to have a big six passenger cabin plane of the Inter-Lake
				Airways, Ltd., of Toronto, drop in the bay in front of our Clubhouse at the dinner hour one
				quiet Saturday. It soon developed at the visit was part of a publicity program of the
				Company, which is planning regular service between Toronto, Penetang and Parry sound. In a
				very short time the bird men were taking up parties of our campers for short flights, and
				the passenger service to Iron City camp was inaugurated that same evening by the homeward
				flight of Mr. and Mrs. John W. Vickerman, Jr., from camp to Penetang. The visit was so
				successful that the plane played a return engagement the following Monday, when another
				bunch of campers became air minded. And there was serious discussion of the possibility of
				service between Toronto and Camp via airline the coming season.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>Iron City of Today</p>
			<p>
				The gradual growth away from the pioneer ideal of “roughing it” in the wilds, and toward the
				more material comforts and a modern summer home, may be traced to the period quite closely
				coincident with the presidency of Mr. Horner. Before that period greater comfort in
				traveling style had become the rule. Through trains with special Pullman and baggage cars,
				special dining car, and the boat trip into our own dock, took practically all the burden of
				responsibility off the traveler. But greater comforts and camp were just beginning to
				emerge. The first noticeable change was the extension of the circle of tents from the huddle
				in front of the Club House around the crescent and through the Pine Woods to the point and
				across to the Island. This enabled the elimination of all tents between the crescent and the
				water, and the spacing of the tents far enough apart to give some privacy.
			</p>
			<p>
				Along with this development there was a change in the financial policy of the Club away from
				strict economy, with its constant and pestiferous deficits and consequent assessments,
				toward a somewhat more expensive and decidedly more comfortable basis, where known and
				anticipated expenses were budgeted and the income set to meet then. It has been a good many
				years since the Club paid a debt with an note, a practice that was quite prevalent
				previously.
			</p>
			<p>
				The most significant feature of this development was the Lodge, built almost entirely with
				voluntary contributions. Located at the center of the larger circle, it was easily
				accessible from all parts of the camp. It furnished a distinct social center for those
				activities of the Club which had theretofore of necessity trespassed somewhat on the Dining
				Room. And the design and character of the furnishings of the Lodge emphasized the change in
				social ideals, being more closely related to the standards of club life.
			</p>
			<p>
				The last step in the development of the camp has been the change from tent to cottage. This
				has brought in its train more of the refinements of home life, running water and the
				cottages, electric lights along the walks and in the Club House and Lodge, and even the
				supplanting of the rather deciduous boardwalks by concrete. Indeed the camp has become no
				longer a place for a temporary outing, but the best sense of the word a summer home, with
				all the comforts, conveniences and permanence the word implies. And as a direct result, the
				term of the outing has increased to seven weeks, and some of the Members even stretch that a
				week or two at either end.
