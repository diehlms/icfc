			Both the Endowment and Charitable Gift Funds represent strategic priorities for Iron City: the
			Endowment to ensure the Club’s long-term financial future & stability, and the Charitable Gift
			Fund to contribute to the needs of the Greater Parry Sound community.
		</p>
		<p>
			For either fund, donations can be made at any time by check or gift of marketable securities.
			Iron City members are also encouraged to consider making a planned gift to one or both funds,
			either through a gift of cash or marketable securities in their will, or designating the
			Fund(s) as a beneficiary of their life insurance policy. For information, contact any member
			of the Charitable Gift and Endowment Funds Committees or the Treasurer. Your support is
			welcomed.

		<strong><p>IRON CITY FISHING CLUB ENDOWMENT FUND</p></strong>
		<em><p>Our Fund for the Future</p></em>
		<p>
			The ICFC Endowment Fund was established to ensure the sustained health of ICFC and serve as a
			reserve should an unexpected expenditure arise and/or monies be needed to help in the
			operation of the Club. All monies are collected and maintained in US currency. Many large
			capital projects have received loans from the Endowment Fund in the past: for example, the
			dining hall renovation, water tower repair, and the purchase of land. Monies borrowed from the
			Endowment Fund to meet these expenses are repaid from operational income.
		</p>
		<p>
			In some circumstances, and only if the Endowment Fund is able to maintain certain levels, the
			Club has the ability to withdraw monies to fund infrastructure and capital projects without
			repayment. The Endowment Fund has served as an important resource for the Club throughout the
			years, and many of our members continue to support the Endowment Fund generously by donating
			money in memory of loved ones or fellow members.
		</p>
		<p>
			Donations can be made at any time of the year in either check form or transfer of marketable
			securities. Donations are not tax deductible. Checks should be made payable to ICFC Endowment
			Fund and mailed to:
