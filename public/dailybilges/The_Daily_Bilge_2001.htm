Well it happened....as if in a dream.....George Stronach just came by the 
weighing station and weighed in a most beautiful bass....and with all the 
witnesses in camp around (me and Emile) we saw it measure 4lb 2ozes 
solid.....the smile on his face was as wide as front bay....so I think that 
declares him winner of the Calhoun for this year.....our deepest condolences to 
AJ....and with wishes for a great summer of fishing for you all next ... oh 
boy.....what fun!!!!!!!!!!!!

Well, this is it.....the computer is heading up to Parry Sound to its' winter 
home so I must also head south....we have had a string of really lovely 
days....John Helen and Adam (so handsome) Boak are here for one week in camp and 
then next and I think they really have the time chosen correctly. There has been 
blue blue blue days....slight chill in the air....the fire ban was lifted cause 
of the rain over the weekend and we had a bon fire on the beach Tuesday 
night....I have never seen stars that brilliant or clear.... </p>

<p>fishing is unbelievable right now also....yesterday I went with Bruce Lawson 
and off of Bertos we must of boated 7 bass....I got a nice 3lber I kissed and 
put back and then a couple of perfectly huge picnic bass...which I will share 
with the whole camp this morning for breakfast....we are a motley crew in the 
dining room right now....about 20 after Helen puts on her navy blue travel suit 
and embarks....for the last week most mornings have been eaten up with good 
byes....but then I'm happy when I'm on a dock..... </p>
<p>George Stronach has two more days technically to go for the Calhoun Cup 
himself (members largest SMB) but if he doesn't make it that will go to A.J. 
Jenkins' SMB she caught off of Bertos.... the Wright Cup will go to Martin 
Jenkins Jr. for his 4lb 1ozer....and the Kinnear Cup to Jesse Prollo (that's 
Derek Martin's daughter) for her 3.2........but we do need to give George the 2 
days....and he is determined.....so stay tuned... </p>
<p>I would say the summer went pretty well.....really well....and would like to 
take this opportunity to thank you all for you kindnesses, flexibility and 
patience....oh yes and humor.....it's a great place isn't it?????? </p>
<p>See you next year one way or the other.....Molly </p>

Oh dear....this time of year seems to just slip away for me....can't believe
that I haven't gotten back to you all sooner than this.....well! here we
go.....the Governor General's visit went very well and very smoothly....just a
neighbor's visit really....there was a lot of speculation about what we should
wear and what she would wear....and she came in a purple linen skirt and tennis
shoes (we&nbsp; had never guessed that!)<br>
Lovely reception at the Steffey's and an elegant dinner by Emile....she said a
few words about sharing the bay with us and her appreciation of the fact that we
are good care takers of the environment...an exchange of gifts....dessert out on
the front lawn and she was off before a storm was going to break across the
bay....<br>
<br>
The a quiet weekend really....Porter and Samantha Scott (Gail was busy with the
most beautiful and calm Heather) headed up the party and Alexis Lyndsey and Rik
Rodefer did the church service....<br>
<br>
Last night was the Paddle Dinner which we tried to switch around a bit this
year.....we had a bbq for dinner and ice cream sundaes on the front lawn for
dessert ....and the Paddle Ceremony by the flag pole....Jason Emond won the
paddle this year (this is definitely the year of the Canadians!!!)....and we
instituted a new award....called The Anchor.....which went to both Ali Andrews
and Ben Johnson for their<br>
outstanding contribution to this year's encampment...<br>
<br>
The fishing is amazing right now....we have come out of the weeks of hot weather
and into a chill of sorts....you can feel it especially in the morning.....my
mother Jake and Sam Morrow decided to go out to Huckleberry for just 45 minutes
yesterday before we were leaving for a picnic...and in that time they pulled in
3 nice sized SMB's....great stuff!!!!!<br>
<br>
The numbers here are slowly beginning to dwindle....down to 103 today....it's
that time of year you spend all morning saying goodbye to people...ugh!!! But on
the upside....it is actually supposed to rain today...which everyone is looking
forward to (except maybe the Stewarts and Andy Martin who are out camping with
their children right now)...but we sure could use the rain and a cabin day will
be very welcome!<br>

Well we are very busy getting ready for Da GG but I can take a few moments to
tell you that Charlie Stewart and his daughter Natalie beat Beth Steffey and
Bennett Reed for the Tolley Cup this year.....it was very exciting tennis in the
finals and there was a huge gallery tucked under the trees out of the sun having
a great time....that tournament is really a great part of our summer here. The
weather continues to be dry....fire ban still on.....we couldn't cook steaks
again this week so we had something called a &quot;Sip and Dip&quot;...we went
out to sunset bay, floated and swam off of boats and Moby Dock....we were real
rebels and make tomato and onion sandwiches with parsley and pepper added....and
they were well received!!!!! Yesterday the artist Lu Robataille came at the
invitation of Nick Steffey and it was a very exciting day....she does wonderful
watercolors of the Georgian Bay and surrounding areas and many of us will be
nailing up one of her paintings on our winter walls to remind us of our summer
homes.....then there was a Sing In at the Old Friends Boathouse last
night....the 17 part harmonies and laughter could be heard on the Front Bay
docks 'til late into the night (I was just happy it wasn't the staff making
noise :&gt;) So there you go.....we will be busy this day with the GG's visit
today. I will make sure to tell you all about that as soon as possible...<br>

This will be just a quick report.....on meeting day on the 2nd all went very
well and smoothly. Lots of meetings and lots of the verb &quot;to porch&quot;
afterwards. But on to the important business of this club....which is
fishing......yesterday was the Todd Cup and it was a great day for
fishing.....there is a very bright moon right now and of course clear and dry
weather and a light breeze actually kicked up and so the conditions were just
perfect for bass fishing.....there must have been 5 or six lovely stringers of
fish up by 5pm....Carol Brammer had a beautiful 3lb on hers.&nbsp; I believe
that Derek Martin Jr. told me on the boardwalk that his daughter Jess got a
3lb2ozer ( the first time she's ever been fishing)..and of course the Fritz
brothers were busy weighing fish out of their famous bass bags....but in the end
Paul Jenkins prevailed and he will be putting his name on the cup (when John
Boak returns it from his last year's victory)....so there you go.... busy week
coming up.....on the 8th is the very exciting Tolley Tennis Tournament. And we
are going to have a visit from a wonderful local artist Lu Robataille that
day....she will be giving a painting class for Arts and Crafts that day and
showing some of her works in the Lodge....and then of course even the loons out
in front of the McCarthy's house are beginning to show their excitement about
the Governor General's visit (I will get excited also when I stop listening to
the staff and all the pranks they what to play in the dining room that
night....but enough of that....) stay in touch!!!!! Molly<br>

So much for slow fishing days......Derek Martin Jr. caught a 5lb 2oz large mouth 
bass off of Whistler's Bay yesterday afternoon. When Sophia Crawford and I were 
kayaking in from an afternoon on the bay I saw Derek down on the front dock with 
a sizable fish and we went over there to see it first hand.... Derek was all 
smiles and told a great story about fishing with his dad and brother in the same 
hole and that his brother was having a time pulling in some monster fish. It 
turned out to be a huge ball of seaweed but in the middle of it was this 
incredible bass (much smaller than 5lbs though)...due to the lack of a net the 
fish got away. They all laughed about the lack of net and came home with the 
story. So I asked Derek if he had a net for the 5-lber today.....and he did that 
Martin chortle laugh and replied &quot;No, no net.&quot; He kept the fish alive to show 
his mom when she arrived right before dinner (and his brother - ) and then bless 
his soul, released it back into our bay. Yep, this is a fishing camp!!!!!!!!!!!<br>

<font size="3">Oh my the first of August has arrived along with the peak of the 
summer....weather continues to be lovely though very dry. We had two 
firefighters down on Monday to talk fire safety and it was very interesting what 
they had to report. First off there is a fire ban in the area right now...which 
will of course not alter &quot;the float&quot; but will change the &quot;steak&quot; part of the 
picnic Friday Night....also they recommended some specific fire emergency 
procedures which Mike and Gregg will report on at the meeting tomorrow night (so 
it will be in the minutes of the meeting).<br>
<br>
I would call the fishing slow right now. I went out on Moby Dock last night and 
while waiting for Colleen and Matt's babysitter (and MD to come around the 
corner) Chris Tadlock and I fished on Schroeder's dock. We caught between 
us....a pike, a bass, a perch and a sunny. Chris also caught the Kinnears boat 
but that story should probably not go into print....There was a huge picnic to 
the Umbrellas yesterday and that might have cut into the regular fishing 
people's time....sure seems like more pike than in the past....but then again 
I'm not sure we targeted pike the way we are now....with the lures and plugs...<br>
<br>
The Bennetts and the Douglasses had a great Saturday Night Party....with a 
Survival theme....you had to bring to the party what you could not survive 
without at Iron City...and then were divided into 2 tribes and the challenges 
began by age groups....it was a hoot. Dave and Charde tied with Jerry Rampelberg 
and Chiz Anderson for Better Ball on the putting and the Campers pulled out a 
win the in the last inning of the softball game. The Brothers Four (Crawfords) 
did the church service on Sunday which was about the journeys we all make to get 
up here.....but more specifically theirs that they made with their dad this 
year. There is a copy of it in the office if you want to take a look at it when 
you get here.<br>
<br>
That's the way it is up here for the last week of July....the Collins all left 
yesterday....it is always a sad day for all of us.. .and a clear sign that 
August is here....<br>

Woke up to a big wind this morn pushing right in my mom's front doors (NE) and I 
came down and lit a fire in the dining room first thing...a pretty far cry from 
the heat of a couple of days ago...one thing about the Georgian Bay...if you 
don't like the weather you are in luck...it changes so regularly....<br>
<br>
In fishing news....Sam Raley brought in a beautiful 3lb SMB a day or so 
ago....he was taking a break from catching snakes and scaring Meg Schade with 
them....and here's a REAL news flash....John Andrews (of the Reed family...not 
necessarily know for their long expertise in fishing)....hung up a 2lb10oz 
lovely the same day....I didn't see the fish last night cause there was a steak 
picnic...windy evening perfect steak night....Jenifer Raley and I decided we 
want to bring the kids out to a rock one night soon...just so they can sit 
around a fire, hear the loons and watch the sun go down the way we did last 
night.....<br>
<br>
Coming up on Monday is our big Fire Safety Day....the Fire and Safety Committee 
(and the Insurance one also) have two fire fighters/consultants coming into 
camp...they are going to take a walk about and then have a round table 
discussion about how to create and maintain the safest camp possible....it 
should be very interesting and certainly pertinent in relation to the fact we 
have had so little rain this year....it is so dry here...wait 'til you see the 
brown moss and dried up bushes everywhere you go...so that's July 30th...we will 
all learn a lot I am sure.<br>

Well the high wind and cold temperatures seems like a dream from ages gone
by....we have hit a spell of warm days with soft winds....this usually
happens when the Sloans are in town.....it was a picture perfect day for
the Collins Cup on Wednesday...and there was a lot of participation this
year but George Stronach prevailed over the group once more and was the
winner.....Emile was cleaning fish 'til late into the night and there were
no picnics yesterday because there were so many people having fish for
lunch....!!!<br>
<br>
We had an adult kayak trip yesterday in the morning....I got to lead it and
we took a loop up by Baldy. past a bay my family calls &quot;Yo Man&quot;...past
Mary
Kinnear's Rock, over thro Pershings Channel (I was checking out new shoals
for a bunch of sacred Steffey fishing holes on the way) There are many
beaver in Pershing's Bay this year. We saw their homes but not them. Going
thro Indian Channel I saw the first Cardinal flowers in bloom of the year
(which is a serious sign of August in my book) and the largest extended
family of Canadian geese I've ever seen up here....must have been forty of
them all ages......all honking away and feeding in the tall grass....they
looked like Iron City folk on the way to the dining room.....<br>
<br>
A group of us sat on the Fritz porch last night.....sipping a little cordial
which seems, once a year, to be a Tolley tradition....and watched an
incredible sunset...which was orchestrated by 2 loons that were swimming
around Pikes Peak....and the voices of the staff and camp children on the
bagel.....my, my, my......what a sight......when is it you people are going
to get up here?.....you are missing all the fun!!!!!!!<br>

Dear ICFC Members,<br>
<br>
The Canadian Governor General, The Honorable Adrienne Clarkson and her husband 
John Ralston Saul a noted philosopher, author and academic have accepted our 
invitation to visit IC in August. These neighbors live in a cabin on one of the 
nearest islands to ICFC (to the right of Pike Peak). They will visit on either 
the 9th or 10th of August. David Mills forwarded a copy of Adrienne's acceptance 
speech. This presentation will give you insight into the life and views of one 
of Canada's most visible and global dignitaries. This
<a href="http://www.gg.ca/speeches/installation-speech_e.html">Speach</a> 
provides a wonderful historical perspective.<br>
<br>
You will learn much about the Canadian heritage and spirit.<br>
<br>
Regards,<br>

Well it happened....I guess I knew it would at some point but it is such an 
amazing sensation ....woke up this morning and the wind was gone....flat calm in 
the front bay on this Sunday morn....I saw a couple of kayaks going across the 
bay at about 6:30am....think I might do the same later.....but this is the first 
morning in a long while with no wind....there has been lots of fishing in the 
North Channel (to get out of the wind) and certainly a lot of sailing and 
windsurfing (Monty is in town...Ted Branch would have been out there if he 
hadn't broken his elbow the day before he came up) Yesterday a big group of 
people went over to <a href="http://www.camp.ca/hurontario/">Camp Hurontario</a> to see an art exhibit by a woman named Lou 
Robataille. Lou is going to be here in camp showing her artwork on August 
8th...I think you will all be amazed to see what she does and want to have it in 
your homes (north and south). Big Saturday Night Party last night....the 
Hugessons and Bruce Lawson ran an Olympic Evening because of the fact Toronto 
came in second for the summer Games of 2008.. Was it..China that won???.... You 
were supposed to come as your favorite foreign country so that the grand march 
could be a parade of nations....I must admit though, I was very proud of how the 
Staff2K1 got involved and all dressed up (Jason and Al were from EmileLand in 
the white kitchen hats and aprons)....it was little Eleanor Burcham about 1 year 
old in a kimono and a sign WE WON on her back that stole my heart. Hopefully 
more fish to report next time ..... </p>

          <p>P.S.:<br>
          I know I am always asking you all why you are not up here....but at 
          this writing what I am curious about is: when ARE you coming? I just 
          checked the books and right now we have 72 reservations for the night 
          of the annual meeting and that seems somewhat low to me....so come on 
          all you august people we need you to begin to think about your dates 
          and make those ever precious reservations so we can plan for the 
          onslaught.....I mean for your vacation!!!!!!!! Email, FAX (we got it 
          working finally) or call ....we are here in the office most mornings 
          and would love to hear from YOU!!!!!!! <br>

I realize that it has been a while....we have all been sort of in a daze since 
Darrin's accident and death. I hope all of you that knew him will be able to get 
his parent's address soon and will be able to write a letter to them. The 
service is tomorrow and I will get a report and let you all know what I find 
out. </p>

          <p>The wind has been very high all week....but the fishing steady and 
          good....my mother and I found a lovely little bay out of the wind the 
          other day and she brought in a great looking bass which we had for 
          breakfast this morn but more importantly we lost an AMAZING one that 
          we will work the summer to see again....like on Todd Cup 
          day.....Stephanie Nuel went out with the Jenkins today and brought in 
          a well over 2lber...I think 2lb13oz...but I not sure....I sat next to 
          her at dinner and she was beaming!!!! </p>
<p>We had our first steak picnic on Monday....with the mighty number of 21 we 
had a great breeze that kept the bugs away all night and with that number the 
steaks and potatoes were cooked to perfection....I saw Jaime Hugesson pour a 
goodly amount of red wine in the potatoes and will admit they were VERY 
different and would recommend this for the rest of the year..... </p>
<p>We had a tennis tournament on Saturday, singles junior style. Alex Johnson 
won but had a hard time of it against Daniel Modic who has the making of a great 
tennis player.....Stan Williams and Patty Steffey won the golf on Sunday.... </p>
<p>So there you go....again it is very cold and very windy.&nbsp; Pack lots of 
sweatshirts when you come though keep in mind we have some green, blue, wine 
color ones in the office this year with a Georgian Bay tree and ICFC in 
them...Jim had them done up and they are selling like hot cakes right 
now.....half the camp is out of electricity tonight cause of a major Hydro 
problem and it is wonderful walking up and down the boardwalk seeing everyone’s 
candles and kerosene lamps lit inside...I am off to play a game of Murder in the 
Dark right now .....why is it you aren't here?????? <br>

all&nbsp; out on the beach having a grand time.....there were 5 entries for the sand 
castle contest....each amazing and fun...one even had a bull frog named Molly 
and lily pads....it of course won a special award..then again they all won 
awards....then s'mores brought in by the Burkes...little frozen buckets of adult 
quenchers by Colleen McCarthy and Debbie Cerskus and the fire works off of Moby 
Dock that went on forever.....VERY special and much thanks to all involved....</p>

          <p class="MsoNormal">Then on Thursday we had an early morning storm 
          that blew our transformer here at the office and the kitchen...much 
          excitement around the fact we had to try to be flush free for the day 
          to take the pressure off the generator and our sewage system...but by 
          the end of the day Hydro was here and a helicopter flew in our new 
          transformer and the lights magically went on during dinner....the 
          sound of flushing toilets could be heard across the bay all night!!!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Still cold today but the sun came out.&nbsp; They did a 
really cute project in Arts and Crafts this morning...wonderful sand paintings 
that our A&amp;C person...Ali Andrews organized and then hung all over the dining 
room....Helen Runnells Dubois and her son Pierre caught a 22lb catfish...by 
reports the fish was longer than Pierre.....and our headwaiter Melissa Milanak 
arrived finally safe and sound tonight....so all is well...quiet bay tonight...I 
almost miss the wild wind we've had but I guess that is because of all the 
mosquitoes in the office...so why is it you all aren't here?????</p>

afternoon and say there are lot of pike and bass from the camp up to Baldy....we

ringing the welcome bell. The Burke's have supplied the s'mores, the McCarthy's

Well, so much for the flat calm...the wind kicked 
          up big time as a front blew through and we had HUGE white caps on the 
          front bay and every body digging in their closets for warm clothes and 
          blankets... we had a BIG pine tree go over in front of Yount's cabin 
          and a lot of minor dock damage.&nbsp; The dock out beyond Reeds 
          actually blew away..it was too wet to putt but the softball was great 
          without the usual attending bugs of one sort or another and the 
          STAFF2K1 blew the campers away (well, it was 8-7)...still big wind 
          today but the regular regimen of picnics are going out anywho...</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Val King got the first bass of the season as bass season 
opened Saturday...1lb16oz SMB and the Modics had a bass and a pike on the board 
before their bags were off the dock....Brandon McCarthy was passing around his 
pike in the dining room last night which was of course the best thing I had 
eaten in a LONG while...</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There was a Crispy Crunch Tournament on the front dock this 
morning...which my brother Nick and passed as we were trying out the newly 
renovated Skipper. (Which is in my humble opinion the most beautiful boat in 
camp right now)..looked like the whole camp was there...and by the way the

          been incredibly beautiful...some folks have dared to complain about 
          the heat but Barbara Boucek and I were both out on the benches by the 
          beach just celebrating the breeze and it being so comfortable...the 
          staff is great this year....they had a great AOT (Adventure 
          Orientation and Training), and are pinning every meal in the dining 
          room. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">CJ Sloan and the book keeper Tom Alphin (a Bucknell friend 
of CJ's who is really fun....stop by the office when you get into town and 
introduce yourself to him) have set up what I refer to as Mission Control in the 
Chief's room for the staff only...5 computers, a burner for music CD's, scanner 
and DVD capabilities with 151 movies to keep little staff minds happy at 
night... </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Emile has a really young staff in this year in the new 
Hilton on the Hill ..stop by there anytime...they will love to show you 
around......No fish to report but then again Clive just got into town last night 
and I'm planning on getting my license today. We are slowly finding out about 
the phones here in camp, a lot of them were blown out by the storm over Memorial 
Day. If you have turned your phone off for the winter....it would be helpful for 
you to turn it on now so you can see it works....let us know what we can do to 
help!!!!!!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I know I say this every time.....but I don't know why you 
all are down there....we have a flat calm morning which would be perfect for a 
kayak, water ski or fishing those hole that are hard to get the anchor to hold 
in the wind....bad day for the Moon but I was wondering about the 
Westerns...perfect Westerns day<br>

<p>The Boaks report an out-of-season record catch for John and Helen! A 7 lb 10 oz 
small mouth baby Boak measuring 20 inches in length!<br>
<br>
This little guy has been big news on the Boak front. With John at Helen's side, 
Adam Michael Boak was born April 25, 2001 at 8:27 pm in Bethlehem, PA, ten days 
earlier than the 2001 solar/lunar tables predicted. Adam is a blessing and John 
&amp; Helen are just thrilled to embark on their lifelong journey of parenting.<br>
<br>
Helen plans to return to work in July as John will take on the full-time role of 
being Mr. Mom, but not before he makes his first visit to ICFC when camp opens. 
Then, at the end of August, the Boak threesome will head north for Adam's first 
ICFC visit. Rah, rah, ray... three Boaks on the bay!<br>
