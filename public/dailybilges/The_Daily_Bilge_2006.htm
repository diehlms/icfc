  <u><font size="4"><b>August 21, 2006:<br>
	</b></font></u>I have a suspicion that this may be the last entry for the 
	year, since there is only Brian Sloan left on the leader team and a mere 5 
	waiters. This sunny Monday morning is what we dream of when we think of the 
	end of camp at Iron City - bright sunshine, a cool 60 degrees, a light 
	breeze, and forecast of 73 and sun this afternoon. Heaven on earth.<br>
	<p>After what was a very sad week in the history of Iron City, things crept 
	back to normal as fine weather and great friends greeted each day. The 
	Paddle Dinner was a huge success with the finest food ever served, and the 
	winner was announced - congratulations to Alexis Rodefer! You might 
	appreciate the attached poem by Brian Sloan (edited extensively).<br>
	</p>
	<p>The campers won the last ball game of the season with Bobby Reigeluth at 
	the mound - a huge comeback in the final innings with a win by one run. As a 
	gesture of great thanks for all their hard work this year, campers cleared 
	the dinner plates for staff anyway.<br>
	</p>
	<p>We all arrived at breakfast this morning to hear the tale of two rock 
	bass, six small frogs and one bullfrog that had somehow found their way into 
	the drinking water cooler reservoir in the kitchen overnight - mother nature 
	works in strange ways - Chef John found the lid askew and the two rock bass, 
	but no frogs were to be seen, until later when the bullfrog alone was found 
	in the corner of the pantry. Can anyone solve the mystery of the fate of the 
	small frogs?<br>
	</p>
	<p>The orange juice tasted OK to me. Others weren't so certain.<br>
	</p>
	<p>The kids emptied out the store this morning - small amounts of candy and 
	soda were made available to all for free - there's another reason to stay 
	until the end of camp.<br>
	</p>
	<p>On behalf of our leadership team - Brian, Rory, David, Devon and Maggie - 
	Thanks to everyone for helping to make this a wonderful summer for all of 
	us. We'll see you next year on the Bay, and hopefully elsewhere in the 
	meantime.<br>

	<p>An Ode to the Quasquicentennial Wait Staff<br>
	By Brian Sloan<br>
	Edited extensively </p>
	<p>Welcome all to the dining hall <br>
	for the &#8217;06 paddle dinner<br>
	We know you&#8217;ve all been wondering<br>
	Just who could be the winner </p>
	<p>The paddle&#8217;s painted prettily<br>
	And placed inside a sack<br>
	I guess this means its set in stone<br>
	There&#8217;s just no going back </p>
	<p>But before we present it<br>
	We thought that we would try<br>
	To introduce our young staff to you<br>
	Before they say goodbye </p>
	<p>They started young, a ruddy bunch<br>
	For whom we were quite scared<br>
	But soon we learned we were quite wrong<br>
	Cause no one really cared </p>
	<p>They&#8217;ve waited the tables and swept the walks<br>
	And guarded the children&#8217;s lives<br>
	At least we know they&#8217;ve done it better<br>
	Than the staff of 2005 </p>
	<p>We the members of the Fab 5<br>
	Catch a lot of flack<br>
	And there&#8217;s no one who knows how to whine<br>
	Quite as well as Zach </p>
	<p>Chas is a fan of tennis<br>
	Who shows a lot of gall<br>
	Cause he even plays at night<br>
	By using a flaming ball </p>
	<p>Robert Morrow came recently<br>
	And he landed quite a gig<br>
	All he has to do to entertain us<br>
	Is dance an Irish Jig<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	</p>
	<p>Ali Ali whats the tally<br>
	Of tables you&#8217;ve waited this year<br>
	We&#8217;ll miss the ceaseless ambition<br>
	That you hold so dear </p>
	<p>Anna is a flautist<br>
	With lots of Texas Pride<br>
	When it comes to arts and crafts<br>
	She never breaks her stride </p>
	<p>Kendall&#8217;s the one who&#8217;s great with kids<br>
	For that he has great fame<br>
	He&#8217;s the guy who always leads them<br>
	In their beloved evening games </p>
	<p>Logan works at gas and store<br>
	And of her job she&#8217;s fond<br>
	Her numbers are sometimes off a bit<br>
	But that&#8217;s ok &#8211; she&#8217;s blonde </p>
	<p>Jenna and Alex became great friends<br>
	And we know that they&#8217;re not shy<br>
	Because they&#8217;ll always sing and dance<br>
	To show their Hips Don&#8217;t Lie </p>
	<p>If you&#8217;re tempted to tell them a secret<br>
	I advise that you refrain<br>
	For they&#8217;ll tell the whole camp as soon as they can<br>
	Cause gossip is their game </p>
	<p>If you have a crick in your neck<br>
	I know a good remedy<br>
	Go visit the store and get a massage<br>
	From our good friend Robby </p>
	<p>A warning to the parents <br>
	Whose kids enjoy to swim:<br>
	When Nick&#8217;s on duty at the beach<br>
	You shouldn&#8217;t count on him </p>
	<p>Instead rely on Megan<br>
	At least when she&#8217;s not hurt<br>
	It seems her coordination<br>
	Gets the best of her<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	</p>
	<p>Hallie is a caring girl<br>
	Who always gives a hug<br>
	She&#8217;s also known for her wonderful skill<br>
	At giving a great back rub </p>
	<p>The flowers in camp are colorful<br>
	And healthy, that&#8217;s for certain<br>
	It&#8217;s thanks to this summer&#8217;s water girl<br>
	Our very own Brita Bergland </p>
	<p>Who reminds me of the next boy<br>
	Who certainly out-stands you<br>
	Our staff Red-Head, the big strong man<br>
	Yes ladies, Colin Andrews </p>
	<p>Alexis helps with Arts and Crafts<br>
	With limitless love and care<br>
	And you can always find her<br>
	By looking for her blue hair </p>
	<p>We&#8217;d love to continue for all the staff<br>
	Kitchen workers and Gary&#8217;s crew<br>
	But we&#8217;ve decided to hold back<br>
	To keep this short for you </p>
	<p>So tonight it&#8217;s the staff before you<br>
	Which deserves your many thanks<br>
	They&#8217;ve done the work and done it well<br>
	Each member through the ranks </p>
	<p>I think you&#8217;ll all agree with me<br>
	That there&#8217;s just no other way<br>
	To show your appreciation<br>
	With an Iron City Rah Rah Ray</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
  <u><font size="4"><b>August 5, 2006:<br>
	</b></font></u>Hello IRON CITY!
	<p>Camp is getting full ladies and gentleman so get your reservations in 
	while you can! We may not have any &#8220;limited time only&#8221; offers or 
	complimentary day-care, but there are put-put tournaments and some fishing 
	to be had so get up here before it&#8217;s too late! We had a torrential rain fall 
	this past week&#8212;well it wasn&#8217;t really a rainfall, it pretty much flew 
	sideways as if fired from a mini-gun by Arnold Schwarzenegger. But Arnold 
	won&#8217;t be back and the weather has turned for the much better, so no excuses 
	any more for shy campers such as yourselves to not be hopping on a plane or 
	in a car and coming up to the bay. </p>
	<p>Well now that you&#8217;ve been properly warned, here is the news from the far 
	north: </p>
	<p>This past Tuesday we had our first ever Wooden Boat Regatta complete with 
	Picnic and sunset cruise for wooden boats of all shapes and sizes. It was 
	pretty amazing to see the range of vessels out on the water with a rowboat 
	from the turn of the century and an outboard from 1926 all the way up to 
	inboards from the 1990&#8217;s. A big round of applause to Bobby Reigaluth, George 
	Milligan, and Greg Scott for their organization of the event. </p>
	<p>Just yesterday we had the 2006 Todd Cup, awarded to the fisherperson with 
	the largest stringer of small-mouth bass, and after many competitive entries 
	ranging from illegally fished stringers to a small spotted turtle, David 
	Fritz was the wire to wire victor with 6lbs of bass by the end of the day.
	</p>
	<p>Well that brings us to today with the opening rounds of the Tolley Tennis 
	Tournament starting this morning, we&#8217;ll be sure to update you all on the 
	winner. </p>
	<p>Lastly, are you looking for something to wear to a tennis tournament? A 
	country club? The US Open? What about something to hide the Iron City beer 
	gut? Well sitting next to me in the Iron City office are piles and piles of 
	125th anniversary Golf-Shirts in Navy and White and we have all sizes from 
	small to extra large so grab one while you can. If you aren&#8217;t going to be 
	here &#8216;till near the end of camp, give us a call at 705-375-2300 and we&#8217;ll 
	set on aside for you! </p>
	<p>That&#8217;s all the news from the bay! We&#8217;ll keep you posted.&#8217; </p>

	<p><u><font size="4"><b>July 26, 2006:<br>
	</b></font></u>Hello Campers, here is what news we have from the bay;
	</p>
	<p>As part of our quasquincentenial celebrations, Iron City will have its 
	first ever wooden-boat regalia led by Greg Scott, George Milligan, and Bob 
	Reigeluth. The even will be on Tuesday August 1st with an assembly on the 
	main dock and beach, and we will have a picnic (sign-ups start July 29th). 
	The fleet itself will include all wooden inboards, outboards, canoes, 
	sailing canoes, rowboats and sailboats. </p>
	<p>Hope to see you all there! </p>
	<p>Just last night we continued our weekly evening of storytelling this time 
	with Anne Collins, Jim Kinnear and Charde Bennett, the burden of performance 
	was not on them entirely as there were plenty of contributions and stories 
	related from the attending campers. Everyone got to hear each of their 
	individual stories whether they concerned Jim and Mary&#8217;s early romance to 
	Charde Bennett&#8217;s knife fight with Burt Todd. We hope to see this success 
	continued every Wednesday evening till the end of the summer. </p>
	<p>That&#8217;s all the news from the bay! </p>

	Office Folk, Rory J Kinnear, David Scott, Brian Sloan. </p>
  <u><font size="4"><b>July 19, 2006:<br>
	</b></font></u>Hello Hello Iron City Campers, we have a bunch of dates 
	needing to be saved comin&#8217; up in the next few weeks.
	<p>On Saturday, the 22nd there will a silent auction for the Georgian Bay 
	Land Trust, all proceeds go to the GBLT. </p>
	<p>This Monday, the 24th is the Tom Collins Conservation Cup presided over 
	by Anne Collins. </p>
	<p>The following Friday, the 28th is the Sundowner on the Rocks at San Souci. 
	The cost is $75 a plate and benefits the Georgian Bay Foundation Wetlands 
	Preservation. Details are in the Dining Hall and Office. </p>
	<p>Greg Scott will also be leading a nature walk on the Iron City Trail 
	Monday, July 31st. Biologists Chris Haxel and Rick Sneider will be 
	accompanying the group to identify the plant life along the trail. </p>
	<p>Finally, the weekly storytelling event is now officially every Wednesday 
	night. Our first evening was led by Barbara Boucek and featured a large 
	group of campers, Chip Crawford, Lee Alexander, Eric Williams, Alex Scott, 
	Cynnie Anderson, Eric Williams, and Jim Beatty. Stories of old Staff 
	shenanigans and romances were discussed, the details of which caused much 
	controversy. This past Wednesday had Anne Collins with the help of Greg 
	Scott digging through old Archives to show us what camp was like in the 
	1930&#8217;s as well as shedding light on the details of our first few 
	encampments. </p>
	<p>That&#8217;s the news from the bay we hope to see you all here soon. We&#8217;ll be 
	in the Office from 8am-noon, 1-2pm and 7-8pm and have all the details 
	regarding any upcoming events. </p>

	<p><u><font size="4"><b>July 15, 2006:<br>
	</b></font></u>The wind is picking up here on Georgian Bay after several 
	days of stifling stillness and the flies are being routed from camp, for the 
	time being at least. Numbers are in the mid-July low and not one member of 
	the Vespers committee is here so it looks like God shall go unworshiped this 
	week unless we find someone to lead us. </p>
	<p>Last night we had our first steak picnic of the season and not one camper 
	or guest was apprehended by the OPP!! A hearty success for all. We will also 
	be having a beach day for all in camp this coming Tuesday the 18th. We 
	decided to host a beach day in order to stir up some envy in all of you 
	campers not with us at Iron City. </p>
	<p>Speaking of envy, Clive Runnells has created quite a bit with his recent 
	strings of fish, we have two staff members trying to discover his secrets by 
	stalking him in a canoe, we will keep you all posted. </p>
	<p>White and Navy anniversary Golf shirts are still on sale here in the 
	office. If you need to reach us in the office you can just pick up the 
	phone, our office hours are 8-12am, 1-2pm and 7-8pm. If you cannot reach us 
	during these hours then our bookkeeper is checking the email, at least one 
	of us is always in the office during these times. </p>

	<p><u><font size="4"><b>July 6, 2006:<br>
	</b></font></u>Our 125th Independence Day has come and gone on the bay and 
	camper numbers begin to dwindle. Here in the office we still have a good 
	number of anniversary polo&#8217;s for sale and be sure to grab a pocket knife 
	while you can.
	</p>
	<p>On Monday we had a ping-pong tournament with 18 contestants battling for 
	a Tervis Tumbler containing a crispy crunch. One of our own staffers, Zach 
	Martin, mopped the floor of the lodge with an assortment of Sagers, Pattons, 
	and Chip Crawford to win in a 21-17 victory in the final round. The 4th of 
	July was beset with a small tempest after breakfast but volleyball and 
	sandcastle building went on in the afternoon with nothing less than gorgeous 
	summer weather. Though the competition was informal, the staff&#8217;s Team 
	Domination emerged victorious against the camper team. Anything you may or 
	may not have heard regarding a camper victory in softball last Sunday is 
	unsubstantiated hearsay. Finally Monty Scott and Dr. Laham conquered our 
	Doubles Tennis tournament yesterday morning also winning a Tervis Tumbler 
	containing a crispy crunch. </p>
	<p>The 4th of July featured a grand fireworks display by the Jenks out on 
	Jenks Island and Monty Scott on Pikes Peak. Monty is also accepting optional 
	compensation for the cost of the fireworks.<br>
	<br>
	Speaking of giving money, I would like to invite all campers to contribute a 
	pittance (or more if you wish) to the IC staff fund, the money goes to 
	various staff activities like fishing, tubing, staff trip to Parry Sound, or 
	dinner at Henry&#8217;s fish restaurant. Otherwise the staff gets bored and starts 
	setting things on fire, we must be appeased. Any donation is appreciated.

	<p>Hello

	We the staff are already planning several events for the first week of July 
	including a beach day and possibly ping pong and volleyball tournaments. </p>
	<p>In a rousing victory by a single point the staff defeated the meager 
	number of campers that rose to the challenge and they were given a special 
	tutorial on plate cleaning by Brian Sloan and Maggie Martin. In darker news 
	the very same Maggie Martin was caught stealing from her fellow 
	team-leaders, the object in question was a 1980&#8217;s toy guitar (key-tar) with 
	many enjoyable preprogrammed baselines and guitar riffs. The culprit 
	believed stolen object to be, &#8220;annoying as *&amp;^%.&#8221; </p>
	<p>Back to lighter news, the candy store is fully stocked, our new Chef

	<p><u>
	<font size="4"><b>June 24, 2006:<br>
	</b></font></u>A quasquicentennial comes only so often, about every 125 
	years or so. It is an anniversary that most of us only get to experience 
	once in our lifetimes and it is upon us today. It has been an amazing first 
	day up on the bay now that Iron City&#8217;s 125th encampment has officially 
	commenced, and on behalf of the Staff and Leadership of the Iron City 
	Fishing Club, we beckon to those who still remain south of the bay to join 
	us for the summer. </p>
	<p>125 is going to be a special summer for many reasons not the least of 
	which is the multitude of Camper-Led Initiatives (CLIs) taking place 
	throughout the summer to celebrate our 125th anniversary. Ideas for Iron 
	City&#8217;s quasquicentennial (quah-ski-sen-ten-ee-ul) can be emailed to
	<a href="mailto:nicksteffey@yahoo.com">nicksteffey@yahoo.com</a>.<br>
	<br>
	In addition to the CLIs we will have commemorative 125th anniversary 
	pocketknives available in the office for $10 each, hurry up because there 
	are a limited number and they undoubtedly will be coveted as collectibles 
	worth millions in the years to come. </p>
	<p>We hope for this to be a wonderful summer for you all with an exciting 
	mix of new improvements with a return to traditional camp activities. 
	Remember when dessert was home cooked right in the dining hall? Or when 
	canoes were not merely relaxing mode of transportation but a trusty steed 
	suitable for aquatic jousting? You may not remember all of the old-timey 
	traditions of yester-year, but we hope that the commemorative activities 
	planned for each and every week this season will enhance and enrich all of 
	our experiences up here at Iron City. </p>
	<p>Summer 2006 will be very special for one other reason: our new chef. John 
	Saunders (the Colonel) of Sodexho catering will be serving the camp this 
	year and we on the staff could not be more excited. Us waiters and office 
	folk have been fed daily by the wonderful kitchen staff while training for 
	opening, and after polishing through the homemade apple crumble and whipped 
	cream we gave a rousing two thumbs up to the Colonel. We are confident you 
	will enjoy how they have &#8220;raised the bar&#8221; in the Dining Hall. We are 
	fortunate to have leather punchers included in the new commemorative 
	pocketknives for adding a few extra holes to our belts. </p>
	<p>The team leaders and the Head Chef have been busy training the ICFC wait 
	staff over the last few days and as a final coup de théâtre the staff 
	attempted a canoe trip and campout. The evening was a success despite the 
	late night flight back to camp with a thunderstorm biting at our heels. The 
	staff was assured that it was a bonding experience. </p>
	<p>A few bits of business, Gary would like to remind us that it is 
	especially important for children to be kept from playing on or around the 
	water tower area, it is very easily broken and can become dangerous. Also a 
	variety of ICFC clothing is still available for purchase in the office and 
	phonebooks are available on request.<br>
	Look forward to seeing you on the bay! </p>

    Fourteen intrepid campers ventured to IC for Winterfest VII. We met the 
	Beattys for dinner and a Barrie Colts hockey game Thursday Feb 9th arriving 
	on the bay Friday morning
	(on snow mobiles rented from Muskoka Proline in Port Carling). Wally, CJ and 
	Rik arrived
	a day early to warm up the camp, and provision the cabins for the arrival of 
	the main group. Cabins in use were: Rodefer, Lawson, Sloan and W. Crawford.
	<br>
	<p>Nick and Fred drove from Boston with a complete New England Clam Bake 
	(fresh lobster, lobster bisque, and clams). Other facets of the trip 
	included curling at the MacTier Curling rink, dinner at the Crane Lake Lodge 
	and a wintry picnic campfire lunch the open side of Green Island. <br>
	</p>
	<p>Bryan Phillips was able to visited the beautifully renovated Sipe (now 
	Phillips) cabin with the camp architect extraordinaire, Gary Johnson. Bob 
	Boucek and Gary walked the Boucek site where the cabin foundations are now 
	planted firmly in the Precambrian shield. (Bob will be talking with Barbara 
	about clearing low vegetation to be sure there is a clean view of the Audrey 
	and Sandy Phillips Memorial Shed.) <br>
	</p>
	<p>Jaime Hugesson is vying for the IC extreme sports award as he was sighted 
	skiing behind a fast moving snow mobile operated by Ted Branch. <br>
	</p>
	<p>CJ and Ted constructed a massive 18 foot bonfire on the ice our last 
	night. The fire was still burning the following morning to welcome a new 
	snow fall - picture camp dusted with white powder from the ground to the top 
	of the trees.............. <br>
	</p>
	<p>The Gregiores were with us for most activities and were one of the best 
	support teams you can imagine.....keeping us on the trail and out of harms 
	way. <br>
	</p>
	<p>Soon the Spring will descend and camp will awaken to the sound of 
	returning wildlife, and wild flowers; busy workers and laughter. Camp 
	vitality depends on 'camper days' so plan your family Iron City vacation to 
	enjoy as many days on the bay as you can arrange.<br>
